# Requires Sherlock Holmes
- Saving then loading: card location & multiple connections change

# TO FIX!‽
- Save then load -> deleting card causes undefined break link belonging to card linking to deleted card.
- HTML sanitisation: innerHTML from card.text

# Inconvenient
- Request animation frames is not exactly required
- Make it so that clicking on the card container also focuses on the input （rather than only the center input)
- Hover to open UI under card sometimes disappears when trying to move cursor to buttons

# Features
- Mobile support: touch input
- Printer friendliness (day mode: background white)
- Bold, italics, etc. for text
- Peer connections for collaboration (hard, started)
- Resizing card manually (nice to have)

## Done
- Color change: text, arrows (where to put UI though, appear on text focus?)
- Z-index: move to top when focused
- Images in cards
- Deleting card leaves connection del btn 
- Loading from file breaks connections

## Bayemite: working memory
- force card dimensions
- Undo/redo
- peer JS
