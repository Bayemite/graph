# TO FIX!
- Loading from file breaks connections

# Inconvenient
- Make it so that clicking on the card container also focuses on the input
- Hover to open UI under card sometimes disappears when trying to move cursor to buttons

# Features
- Color change: text, arrows (where to put UI though?)
- Multi connections
- Printer friendliness (day mode: background white)
- Bold, italics, etc. for text
- Peer connections for collaboration (hard)
- Resizing card manually
