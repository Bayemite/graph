# TODO

## Features
- Peer connections for collaboration (hard, started)
    - Reconnecting?
- keyboard shortcuts
- Resize images independent of containing card
- Mobile support: touch input
	- Zoom does not really work
		- Fix: stop pinch zoom if possible and/or add +/- zoom buttons
	- Creating cards, linking cards, and peer to peer work
	- Peer seems to immediately disconnect if you unfocus the window
  - Reveal on hover buttons cannot work
- Google Drive/Microsoft integration/peer auth.
	- Could be a priority, as some users may not want to have to manually use something like OneDrive to store mindmaps

## Potential ideas
- Auto layout
- Spoken commands
	- Perhaps possible via Whisper.cpp wasm and the tiny model or similar
	- -> use fuzzy search to match to xommands, embedding model is likely too large
- Smart categorisation
- More themes
- Integration with other tools
- Node/card search
- Analytics of how many times card has been clicked on or edited

## Other
- Resolve massive image sizes (practically unusable at the moment)
- Drag and drop image onto the blank background creates a new node with the image on it
- Fix any issues with peer connections
  - Fix issue with emojis in peer connections
  - Reset peer sidebar when host stops sharing
- Resolve any bugs
- Bring back theme change transition animation?

## Bayemite
- peer JS
    - don't replace share url so that reload doesn't disconnect
    - Reconnect between reloads
    - security?
    - Diffing for cards
- Peer user cursor location
    - follow other cursors
    - Custom cursors/edit locks
- undo deltas (hard?)
- use Worker for saving (perf)

## Technotech
- Fix styling with checkbox and input
- Mindmap templates
  - Dialog with templates to choose from
  - Open when creating new map
- Show peer text cursors and selected cards?
- Font configuration
  - Open small window instead of font size toggle
  - font size, family, font weight, color, alignment in card
- Color theme in settings window (reimplement)
  - Change light and dark colours
  - Add more interesting themes?
  - Custom background
- Peer chat
  - Show in sidebar

## Done
- change link to actual url (dev -> main)
- Peer user cursor location
    - Forward from host to peers
    - Match color in collab sidebar list
- Add feature to move nodes using arrow keys so you can adjust the node locations specifically
- Resizing card manually (nice to have)
- Printer friendliness (day mode: background white)
  - (styling partial)
  - display none for ui elements
- Bold, italics, etc. for text
- Color change: text, arrows (where to put UI though, appear on text focus?)
- Z-index: move to top when focused
- Images in cards
- Deleting card leaves connection del btn 
- Loading from file breaks connections
- Sidebar
- Use File System Access API for offline storage (esp. autosaves)
- Request animation frames no longer required
- Hover to open UI under card sometimes disappears when trying to move cursor to buttons
- Add move card UI (dotted box, something like for the resize UI?)
