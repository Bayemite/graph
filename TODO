# Features
- Peer connections for collaboration (hard, started)
- keyboard shortcuts
- Resize images independent of containing card
- Mobile support: touch input
- Google Drive/Microsoft integration/peer auth.

## Potential ideas
- Auto layout
- Spoken commands
- Smart categorisation
- More themes
- Integration with other tools
- Node/card search
- Analytics of how many times card has been clicked on or edited

## Bayemite
- peer JS
    - change link to actual url (dev -> main)
    - don't replace share url so that reload doesn't disconnect
    - Reconnect between reloads
    - security?
    - Diffing for cards
- Peer user cursor location
    - follow other cursors
    - Custom cursors/edit locks
- undo deltas (hard?)
- use Worker for saving (perf)

## Technotech
- Mindmap templates
- Font configuration

## Other
- Drag and drop image onto the blank background creates a new node with the image on it

## Done
- Peer user cursor location
    - Forward from host to peers
    - Match color in collab sidebar list
- Add feature to move nodes using arrow keys so you can adjust the node locations specifically
- Resizing card manually (nice to have)
- Printer friendliness (day mode: background white)
  - (styling partial)
  - display none for ui elements
- Bold, italics, etc. for text
- Color change: text, arrows (where to put UI though, appear on text focus?)
- Z-index: move to top when focused
- Images in cards
- Deleting card leaves connection del btn 
- Loading from file breaks connections
- Sidebar
- Use File System Access API for offline storage (esp. autosaves)
- Request animation frames is not exactly required
- Hover to open UI under card sometimes disappears when trying to move cursor to buttons
- Add move card UI (dotted box, something like for the resize UI?)
