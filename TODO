  - Fix issue with emojis in peer connections
  - Reset peer sidebar when host stops sharing
- Resolve any bugs

## Bayemite
- peer JS
    - don't replace share url so that reload doesn't disconnect
    - Reconnect between reloads
    - security?
    - Diffing for cards
- Peer user cursor location
    - follow other cursors
    - Custom cursors/edit locks
- undo deltas (hard?)
- use Worker for saving (perf)

## Technotech
- Fix styling with checkbox and input
- Mindmap templates
  - Dialog with templates to choose from
  - Open when creating new map
- Show peer text cursors and selected cards?
- Font configuration
  - Open small window instead of font size toggle
  - font size, family, font weight, color, alignment in card
- Color theme in settings window (reimplement)
  - Change light and dark colours
  - Add more interesting themes?
  - Custom background
- Peer chat
  - Show in sidebar

## Done
- change link to actual url (dev -> main)
- Peer user cursor location
    - Forward from host to peers
    - Match color in collab sidebar list
- Add feature to move nodes using arrow keys so you can adjust the node locations specifically
- Resizing card manually (nice to have)
- Printer friendliness (day mode: background white)
  - (styling partial)
  - display none for ui elements
- Bold, italics, etc. for text
- Color change: text, arrows (where to put UI though, appear on text focus?)
- Z-index: move to top when focused
- Images in cards
- Deleting card leaves connection del btn 
- Loading from file breaks connections
- Sidebar
- Use File System Access API for offline storage (esp. autosaves)
- Request animation frames no longer required
- Hover to open UI under card sometimes disappears when trying to move cursor to buttons
- Add move card UI (dotted box, something like for the resize UI?)
