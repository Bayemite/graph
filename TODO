# Requires Sherlock Holmes
- Saving then loading: card location & multiple connections change

# TO FIX!‽
- Save should not reload page
- Peer JS connection sometimes resets save
    - Specifics: you have a local save from connecting to remote host. You then become the  host. When another connects, the local save disappears with relad.

# Inconvenient
- Make it so that clicking on the card container also focuses on the input （rather than only the center input)
- Hover to open UI under card sometimes disappears when trying to move cursor to buttons

# Features
- Z-index: move to top when focused
- Mobile support: touch input
- Color change: text, arrows (where to put UI though, appear on text focus?)
- Printer friendliness (day mode: background white)
- Bold, italics, etc. for text
- Peer connections for collaboration (hard, started)
- Resizing card manually (nice to have)
- Images in cards

## Done
- Deleting card leaves connection del btn 
- Loading from file breaks connections

## Bayemite: working memory
- Undo/redo
- peer JS
