# TO FIX!
- Random reference errors when adding deleting cards for more than a few times

# Inconvenient
- Make it so that clicking on the card container also focuses on the input ï¼ˆrather than only the center input)
- Hover to open UI under card sometimes disappears when trying to move cursor to buttons

# Features
- Color change: text, arrows (where to put UI though, appear on text focus?)
- Multi connections
- Printer friendliness (day mode: background white)
- Bold, italics, etc. for text
- Peer connections for collaboration (hard, started)
- Resizing card manually (nice to have)
- Images in cards

## Done
- Deleting card leaves connection del btn 
- Loading from file breaks connections
